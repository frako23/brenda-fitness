    answer: "You will learn various moves and routines on the floor and pole. Classes are designed to be progressive so we encourage regular attendance.  All moves are designed to combine strength conditioning, cardio and in Sensual Movements…a whole lot of sexy dance moves to wow yourself and anyone you chose to share your new talent with. You will learn to let go of your inhibitions and realize how special and talented you are. All classes are taught in a non-judgmental environment."

    question: "What should I wear?",

    question: "How fit do I have to be to feel comfortable in a class?",
    answer: "The beginner class is designed for all fitness levels. Like other fitness classes, we do not expect that you “get in shape” before taking our pole classes. These classes are meant to bring you to the physical level you are looking to achieve by combining strength and flexibility training together. As you advance, you will develop the upper body and core strength required for the intermediate/advanced level classes."
},{
    id:6,
    question: "Do I need to own a pole to take a pole class?",
    answer: "No, you do not need to own a pole. We provide poles in the classes and offer Pole Playground as an option for those that don’t own their own pole; however you may want to purchase a pole of your own if you plan on pole being your routine workout. That way you can practice anytime you want and show off your skills to that special someone! We have X-Pole brand poles available for purchase through the studio. Inquire today!"
